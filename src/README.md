Primary Objectives:

- [ ] Calculate the area of each shape and display in the shape column of the table

- [ ] Implement row selection state in the table, feel free to use whatever components you like, the only requirement is that the user is able to toggle the selected state of the row on/off and see that state reflected visually.
